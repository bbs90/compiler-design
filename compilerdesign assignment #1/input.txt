ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF DATA STRUCTURE IS ACTUALLY A LIST OF SOME KIND.  CHARACTER
STRINGS ARE LISTS; ARRAYS ARE LISTS.  FILES ARE LISTS THAT ARE KEPT ON AN EXTERNAL
MEDIUM SUCH AS A DISK OR TAPE.  THE STORAGE STRUCTURE IS OFTEN THE REASON FOR
CATEGORIZING LISTS INTO VARIOUS TYPES AND APPLYING SPECIAL NAMES TO THEM.  IN
GENERAL, A LIST IS A LOGICAL COLLECTION OF ATOMS.  AN ATOM IS A COLLECTION OF
RELATED ITEMS CALLED FIELDS; AND A FIELD IS A BASIC UNIT OF INFORMATION.  A FIELD
MAY BE BROKEN FURTHER INTO SUBFIELDS IF CERTAIN MANIPULATION IS REQUIRED ON
ONLY A PORTION OF A DATA ITEM.  WHEN WORKING WITH FILES, WE USE THE TERM RECORD
MORE OFTEN THAN ATOM.  ATOM ORIGINATED IN THE LISP PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,
DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN-SIXTIES.
